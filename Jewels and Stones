/*

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        
        int c=0;
        for(int i=0;i<S.length();i++)
        {
            if(J.indexOf(S.charAt(i))>-1) //if J String has that character , will return its index else -1
            {
                c++;
            }
