/*
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

Example:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101, and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
